# VoiceClone

In order to clone our selected voice we needed to find some audio of the speaker.  I chose Robert Stack based on one of my wife's favorite shows, Unsolved Mysteries. Robert Stack has a great narrative voice , especially for horror and scary films or videos.  Robert Stack was the host of Unsolved Mysteries for many seasons.    In order to isolate this voice we needed to first download either an episode of Unsolved Mysteries, an interview or something else.   We were able to find some audio on youtube.

Next, we had to download the youtube video into an MP4 format.

Once we got our video we needed to strip the video and only keep the audio.

After we had our audio we needed to remove the Unsolved Mysteries intro music.

Once we only had audio we wanted to split the audio by silence.

Then we could concatinate our clips and upload them to be trained.

After training we were able to test our new voice using fish-audio.
